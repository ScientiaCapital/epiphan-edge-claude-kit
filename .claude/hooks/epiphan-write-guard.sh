# PreToolUse guard for the Epiphan MCP server and claude.ai connectors to it. The matcher in
# .claude/settings.json sends every server with "epiphan" in its name here; this decides which calls matter:
#   - the Epiphan Edge tools this kit knows: reads pass, writes need your approval;
#   - any other tool on the device server itself (the kit's "epiphan" server, or a connector named like
#     "Epiphan MCP" / "Epiphan Cloud" / "Test Epiphan Cloud" / "Epiphan Edge") needs approval, even one named like
#     a read (get_*, kb_*), so tools the server adds later are covered;
#   - other Epiphan services (a connector for docs, CRM, ...) are left to Claude Code's normal permissions.
# Disruptive writes (reboot, firmware, stop, delete, presets) get a louder warning in the approval prompt.
# In bypass mode Claude Code skips "ask", so writes are denied there instead ("deny" still applies).
# With EPIPHAN_READ_ONLY=1 in the environment, every one of those calls is denied instead of asked.
# Fails closed: a call it can't read (no tool_name, or one that isn't a string) is denied, never waved through.
# jq is used when present; otherwise grep, which works on a stock Mac and in Git Bash on Windows.
# Keep these lists in step with .claude/settings.json and epiphan-redact.sh (tests/hook-test.sh checks).
